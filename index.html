                <small>SocialCare Chat</small>
                <p>The 'SocialCare Chat' project idea is a website, desktop program, and application that would allow
                    the
                    elderly or those with a disability, to video call and interact with their loved ones with ease. The
                    primary focus of this project is to make digital contact with family and friends uncomplicated for
                    those
                    that may struggle with technology. Other features of this project would include an easily
                    understandable
                    user interface and a login page with voice-activated login options, as well as simple games, such as
                    chess, checkers, and card games.
                    There would also be a large focus on the safety, security and privacy of users data, as it is
                    understandable that some of the users using this program may be at risk to the dangers of the
                    internet.
